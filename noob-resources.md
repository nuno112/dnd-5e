## Glossary

## Learning the basics

### Introduction

In D&D there are a lot of *Rule Sets*. These are the books that have both the rules and the content like races, spells, adventures, etc. The 3 core ones are:

- Player's Handbook
- Dungeon Master's Guide
- Monster Manual

The content is released in books by Wizards of The Coast (WoTC), which you can buy. Still, there is a base rule set - [Systems Reference Document (SRD)](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) - which is free under an Open Game Licence, under which WoTC lets people use the 5E system and a limited ammount of their content. This is how people create, publish and monetize their own content and can still call it D&D. This is called Homebrew content, where people create adventures, races, maps, fan art, etc.


### :mega: Start Here :mega:
- [Basic Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules)
	- This contains pretty much the official introduction to D&D 5E. ***Check Part 2 and 3 on how to begin playing the game***

## Creating your character :construction_worker: :walking:

### Step by step
- [D&D Beyond step by step guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters)
	- I suggest reading this, and then using the D&D Beyond Character Builder or doing it by hand with one of the form fillable sheets. If you are good with computers, maybe also try the automated MPMB's Character sheet (see below), but note that it contains A LOT of content and can get overwhelming. You can also get an idea of the characters by checking out the premade characters (see below)
- [Character creation checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRSuMk0z1w1zlA370GlrwZoR_vG5RccL/view?usp=drive_link)
	- Useful to check if you did not miss anything if you went the manual route.

### Tools and character sheets
- [D&D Beyond character builder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/builder)
	- Requires creating an account, but you can create up to 6 characters for free or choose one of the premade ones. You can then export the character sheet to a PDF and print it. 
	- Has beginner tips.
- [Collection of character sheets in PDF format](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/5E-CHARACTERSHEETS.zip)
	- Almost all are fillable so you can then print them.
- [Dragons of Stormwreck Isle (Starter Set) Ready-to-Play Character Sheets ](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/dnd_starterset_characters.pdf)
- [Additional Ready-to-Play Characters](https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/CharacterSheets1-10.zip)
	- These are not character sheets, but just a summary of the characters.
- [MPMB's Character sheet on steroids](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8vYfzIfO-z6r_T8QEl8uX3j9SiWtZ8A/view?usp=drive_link)
	- This is a fully automated character sheet that tou can then print. Normally thuis only has basic SRD content, but this one has almost everything from official releases to choose from. :speak_no_evil:
	- Requires desktop version of Adobe Acrobat DC (Reader, Pro, or Standard). Reader is free.

## Roleplaying

More than the rules and mechanics of the game, D&D is a *roleplaying* game. This means you should try to play the role of your character. Make your character your own.
